		<h2>1.Downtown Chicago</h2>

		<p>Chicago, Illinois is my favorite place to visit in Illinois. It has a beautiful skyline and lots to sightsee. There are tons of museums and places to shop. The public transport can be taken to China Town and a bunch of other surrounding towns for an affordable price. Walking through downtown is a great way to spend your day.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The Lake Front</li>
